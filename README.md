# The DisCo Framework

A framework for hosting language-agnostic programming contests with distributed live shootouts (**Dis** tributed **Co** ntest shootout framework).

The framework itself is written in Erlang. To use the framework however you should not need any knowledge of the Erlang language.

## Understand

The DisCo framework is based on two architectural ideas.

1. Distribution: let all programs from participants (workers) run at the same time on separate machines to get a live shootout. The workers are wrapped by erlang programs (worker wrappers) on the client machines. There is a central machine to coordinate the contest and display the results.

2. Components: The framework is adapted to a specific contest by replacing executables (components). There are components for GUI (visualization & control) as well as worker output validation and worker input generation.

The components can be written in any language, so no Erlang knowledge is needed to use and adapt the framework.

## Use

A detailed user's guide in german is included, this is only a short overview for people not fluent in german. If anything important is missing, please just open an issue and we will add an explanation.

To use the DisCo framework for your own contest, you should provide at least your own validator component. Other components can be replaced if you want to fine tune functionality.

### Prerequisites

 - Linux
 - Erlang R16B or 17
 - `make`
 - `git` (to automatically download erlang dependencies)
 - ssh client (e.g. openssh)
 - `ip` (to find out local ip address on the server)
 - `rsync`
 - `python3`, `pyqt4-dev-tools` (for general gui component and integration tests)

### Configuration

Look at the documented sample config files for the contests squares, countdown and countdown2.

### Execution

    make run
